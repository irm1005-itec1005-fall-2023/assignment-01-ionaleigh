      <section>
        <h1>The Main Part of the Website</h1>
        <p>If this were an actual brand, this is likely the section where I would use a lot of buzzwords like "hope" and "beauty" or something to convince you to buy a $45 t-shirt. Luckily this isn't, so instead I'm just going to show you this picture of a cat that I like and move onto the next section.</p>
        <img src ="./cat.jpg" alt="Cat"/>
        <p>Isn't he cute? Unless you're viewing this site with a screenreader, in which case all you got was the word "cat" in a robotic voice. Just trust me, he's pretty cute.</p>

      <!--SECTION ONE FAQ-->
        <section>
          <h2>FAQs</h2>
            <section>
             <h3>What do you actually sell?</h3>
              <p>We don't know, please stop asking us, it's very stressful.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
             <h3>Why can't I close this tab and why did it randomly open up on my browser when I opened a new tab?</h3>
             <p>Only one question at a time please, next.</p>
            </section>
           <section>
             <h3>Was the picture of the cat actually cute? I'm using a screenreader and I don't quite trust you.</h3>
              <p>Wow. That's incredibly hurtful. What ever happened to having a little faith in people? I don't even want to answer questions anymore, you've entirely ruined my mood. I'm moving onto the next section.</p>
          </section>
         </section>

      <!--SECTION TWO TESTIMONIALS-->
        <section>
          <h2>Customer Testimonials</h2>
          <p>After that incredibly hurtful question, I think we could all do with some nice, positive, customer testimonials, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"I just want you guys to leave me alone, I don't even understand what you sell and I doubt you do either. Stop showing up at my house"</li>
            <li>"dsgahoifydigsauhdpsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa sorry, my cat walked across my keyboard. Wait, who are you?"</li>
            <li>"I bought a terrible shirt for $45 and feel just ok about it, I guess."</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

      <!--SECTION THREE TABLE-->
        <section>
          <h2>Table</h2>
          <p>Alright I'm all out of ideas and am admitting defeat, I no longer know what to add to this website that would even vaguely make sense but I still want full marks so I'm gonna rank all my potential ideas for this section in a table.</p>
            <table>
              <caption>Iona's Table Of Ideas</caption>
              <thead>
                <tr>

                  <th>Idea</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>

                <tr>
                  <td>3</td>
